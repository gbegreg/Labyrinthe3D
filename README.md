 Video game 3D with Delphi
 
This project is an example of 3D game developed with Delphi (Sydney 10.4.2). It was produced for the article "Labyrinthe en 3D avec Delphi" from Programmez! magazine number 248 (https://www.programmez.com/).

This game is cross-platform and you will find the binaries for Windows, Mac OS, Linux and Android in the bin repository.

It does not use any game engine ! So i can proudly indicate "Not made with Unity" :)

How to play
On desktop platform, you can use arrows to move and turn and you can use A and E keys (on an AZERTY keyboard) to shift left or right.
You need to find the switch to activate the exit and find it to win.
